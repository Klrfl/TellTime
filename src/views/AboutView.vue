    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      TellTime is an application born from a Project-based learning project.
      This app was made by three Indonesian 10th grade students, which consists
      of one main developer, (me,
      <a href="https://github.com/Klrfl" target="_blank">Klrfl</a>), and two
      designers (<a href="https://github.com/thaaadek" target="_blank">Atha</a>
      and <a href="github.com/Devano02" target="_blank">Devano</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This app was not meant to be for daily or real use, but for us to learn
      web programming in general; but we still tried to make it as usable as
      possible. If you found it useful, thank you so much! We are sorry for any
      inconsistencies, bugs or errors within the app. If you found any, please
      make an issue on this app's
      <a href="https://github.com/klrfl/TellTime" target="_blank">Github repo</a
      >. PRs and/or any constructive criticism are very much welcomed!
